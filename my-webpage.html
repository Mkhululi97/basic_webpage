          I'd love to visit my cousin since she recently moved to Cape Town, I'd
          also love to see where exactly is Project CodeX located. Visiting the
          busy night life of Cape Town especially the long street, those are
          some the reasons why I'd like to visit Cape Town

          A foriegn Language that I would like to learn is Swahili. Swahili is
          the most spoken African language, it sounds so cool and it's easy to
          learn. Knowing Swahili would allow to have conversations with some of
          our African brothers and sisters as they tend to be in our communities
          more often and they help us with all sorts of hard labour.

              It serves as the primary airport for domestic and international
              travel for South Africa. And since 2020, it is Africa's second
              busiest airport, In late 2005, a name change was proposed for the
              airport to "O. R. Tambo International", after former ANC President
              and anti-apartheid activist Oliver Reginald Tambo, an apparent
              change to the precedent of neutrally-named airports.
